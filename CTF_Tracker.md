Also making sure there are relevant policies for people to go by. It all sounds super interesting. And I learned that the projects I do are now making so much more sense. Also - it gave me good ideas for more detection rules in my LogSniper | Nothing really, it was fun and informative | I could write down the theory stuff and try to memorize it more, becasue it sounded useful. Checking real world names for such tools |

| 2025-08-10 (5 min) | picoCTF | FANTASY CTF | Introduction + rules | I used WSL for this | None | Just connecting via command to get a grasp of rules: make only one account, don’t share artifacts, don’t do writeups unless winners are declared. And don’t look for flags outside of scope of ctf of course. | None | None |
| 2025-08-10 (10 min) | picoCTF | WebDecode | Inspecting and decoding | [https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/encode_decode](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/encode_decode) | None | Just got to inspect a webpage and on one of subpages there was a code hidden in some html element. Pasting the code into google search gave me  the encode_decode google app. Decoding the code in base64 gave me the flag. Learned where things might be hidden on the page and that there is a reliable tool for coding/decoding. | I struggled to what to look for at the beginning | None |
| 2025-08-11 (70 min) | TryHackMe | Windows Command Line | cmd.exe | cmd.exe, Linux command line | None | set, ver, systeminfo, more, driverquery | more, help, cls; ipconfig, ipconfig /all, ping target_name, tracert target_name, nslookup target_name, nslookup target_name ip_number, netstat, netstat -h, netstat -abon; cd, dir, dir /a, dir /s, tree, cd, cd target_directory, cd .., mkdir directory_name, rmdir directory_name, type, more, copy, move, del, erase, *; tasklist, /?, tasklist /FI “imagename eq sshd.exe”, taskkill /PID target_pid; BONUS: chkdsk, driverquery, sfc /scannow, shutdown /s | None | Gotta use it in practice |

| 2025-08-11 (30 min) - 37% | TryHackMe | Investigating Windows | Forensics | PowerShell, Event Viewer, Task Scheduler, etc. | It was full on attack, lots of techniques I presume | I did only 37% of tasks, can’t do more right now. But I figured version and year of windows machine from PS. I figured who lat logged on (it was me). And I noticed IP connecting to my machine at the start - it was in cmd on auto-start. Then I checked in Task Scheduler what’s the name of malicious task, what does it do and which port the file listens locally. I checked Event Viewer as well but I couldn’t find any useful information. | I still don’t know how to check when was the last login, how to check when did the compromise take place, what tools were used, how to check for DNS posoning and much more | That CTF was difficult for me. I am glad I did the 37%. I should find something easier or just focus on other material for now |
| 2025-08-12 (60 min) | TryHackMe | Linux Shells | Linux Fundamentals | Bash | None | echo $SHELL, cat /etc/shells, chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh, history, similarities and differences of bash, fish and zsh; .sh, #!/bin/bash, echo, read name, ./, for i in {1..10}; do echo $i done; if else, comments, sudo su. At the end was good practical excercise, to modificate a script and look for a flag | Nothing really | I should compare all 3 CLIs I know right now |
| 2025-08-13 (60 min) | TryHackMe | Networking Concepts | Networking | Bash | None | OSI ISO Model explained once again with some additions; same with TCP/IP model (sometimes it is presented with the fifth layer - physical layer); IP adresses and routing explained once again (there are three ranges of private IP adresses); UDP vs TCP again; encapsulation was more explained - TCP - segment vs UDP - datagram, with example of a life of a packet; using telnetm changing the port | None | I can add new information to the notes |
| 2025-08-13 (60 min) | TryHackMe | Networking Essentials | Networking | None | None | Repeating and expanding information: DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DORA); ARP - Address Resolution Protocol (bridge between second and third layer); ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol (ping, traceroute, tracert - already used those commands); Routing protocols: old ones: OSPF - Open Shortest Path First and RIP - Routing Information protocol; and new ones: EIGRP - Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol and BGP - Border Gateway Protocol; NAT - Network Address Translation: techniaclly it makes power of 2 addresses. Also there were exaples shown in Wireshark, which is nice. | Routing protocols methods - I didn’t memorize them (although it was said those are beyond scope of this room) | I’ll try to understand the protocols while writing notes |
| 2025-08-13 (1 min) | picoCTF | Inspect HTML | Web Exploitation | None | None | I just inspected the page and the flag was in the comments. Easiest flag of my life. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (2 min) | picoCTF | Insp3ct0r | Web Exploitation | None | None | I inspected the page, part 1/3 of the flag was right there in the comments, part 2/3 of the flag was in the CSS file, part 3/3 of the flag was in the JS file. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (10 min) | picoCTF | where are the robots | Web Exploitation | None | I checked the file I wasn’t supposed to, but I didn’t brutecheck it, so I don’t know if it’s classified (Maybe T1594?) | I accessed the file robots.txt by writing it to the url (/robots.txt), there was another link hidden → reaching it has given me a flag | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (5 min) | picoCTF | dont-use-client-side | Web Exploitation | None | None | I inspected the site and found fragmented flag in the code. I put it together and that’s it. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (+30 min) | picoCTF | GET aHEAD | Web Exploitation | WSL | I used a method via bash | The solution was hidden in the name of the challange. I checked on the internet how to use defferent http methods, opened my WSL and used “curl —head site-address”, and got the flag in the terminal. | I struggled with imagining how creative CTFs can be | None |
| 2025-08-13 (3 min) | picoCTF | Includes | Web Exploitation | None | None | Inspected the site, flag was hidden in css file and js file. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (15 min) | picoCTF | Local Authority | Web Exploitation | [hashes.com](http://hashes.com) (wasn’t useful though) | None | The task was to use proper login and password to log in. I had to missinput first, then inspect the page with an alert, then check that in the page there was a fucntion used to check if the credentials are correct, and then get into linked JS file to check what were right credentials. I also learned that how numbers and letters look in ASCII and how to “dehash” - there was hashed successful login information for an admin. I have no clue what was the purpose of it though. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (3 min) | picoCTF | Unminify | Web Exploitation | None | None | So the code of file was just put in one line. I had to scroll to the right to find the flag in the comment. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (3 min) | picoCTF | Bookmarklet | Web Exploitation | [Playcode.io](http://Playcode.io) - just to use their online code editor | None | Copied the code that was in plain sight, opened online JS code editor, pasted it into it, got the flag in an alert. | None | None |
| 2025-08-14 (65 min) | TryHackMe | Networking Core Protocols | Networking | bash, telnet, Wireshark | None | New and old stuff. DNS {TCP/UDP - 23} - Domain Name System: its records: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX. whois. HTTP(S) {TCP - 80 (443)} - Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (Secure): GET, POST, PUT, DELETE; telnet {TCP - 23} GET /file.html HTTP/1.1 Host: anything. FTP {TCP - 21} - File Transfer Protocol: USER, PASS, RETR, STOR. SMTP {TCP - 25} - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol: HELO/EHLO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, DATA, ., .

I didn’t use Wireshark yet, but results of most of the protocols were shown on Wireshark. | I don’t remember all the methods a protocol has | I can revise the methods |
| 2025-08-14 (75 min) | TryHackMe | Networking Secure Protocols | Networking | Wireshark | I checked packets with aquired public key to get credentials (no technique afaik) | Encrypting protocols from the last chapter. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) kinda evolved to TSL (Transport Layer Security). It all took more than 20 years. TLS (like SSL) is working on transport layer; TLS certificate → CSR → CA; Let’s Encrypt. HTTP + TLS → HTTPS; getting encryption key; TLS adds a step between TCP handshake and http communication. HTTPS → 443; SMTPS → 465 and 587; POP3S → 995; IMAPS → 993; telnet → SSH (Secure Shell). SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) → 22; FTPS (File Transef Protocol Secure) → 990; VPN (Virtual Private Network) → mainly data goes through Main Branch VPN Server, bit it can differ. I used Wireshark to check packets, because I had right TLS key. It was very interesting seeing it all in action. It took me a while to find right packet with credentials though. | I don’t remember port numbers | I can revise port numbers |
| 2025-08-14 (110 min) | TryHackMe | Wireshark: The Basics | Tools - Wireshark | Wireshark, bash | None | Use cases of the tool. How the tool look, what type of files does it load (PCAP - Packet Capture), how the coloring works, how to sniff a traffic, how to merge PCAP files, how to view file details. Packet dissection - packet detailes and how they correlate with OSI layers. Packet navigation: packet numbers, go to packet, find packets, mark packets, export packets, export objects (Files), time display format, expert info and its meaning. Packet filtering: apply as filter, conversation filter, colorise conversation, prepare as filter, apply as column and follow stream. The room was very practical, ctf-like excercises. I liked it. It is good to see how the knowledge applies in action. Great tool. | None | I’ll try to use the tool for practical ctf-s |
| 2025-08-14 (80 min) - 81% | TryHackMe | Warzone 1 | Forensics | Wireshark, Brim, Network Miner, VirusTotal | None | I think I could do a writeup. I didn’t finish the room (81%) but I got pretty close. On Brim I checked the signature of malware. Then I got but destination and source IPs of it (wrote it in defanged format), I used VirusTotal to check what group was associated with the malware (TA505), also checked that family of the malware was called MirrorBlast and majority of file types were Windows Installers. Then I used Wireshark to check user-agent of flagged IP address - it was REBOL View 2.7.8.3.1. Then I used Brim again to find 2 adresses that also sent malware. Then I used Brim and Wireshark to check names of the files. At the end I was looking for paths of installation for the files on Wireshark - in binary packets info and streams. I found 2 path files of 4, so it’s not too bad. I am so proud of myself. First big, practical ctf almost done. | I couldn’t find path file names | I should check it out on the internet or ask sb |
| 2025-08-15 (70 min) | TryHackMe | Tcpdump: The Basics | Tools - TcpDump | Tcpdump, bash | None | tcpdump, libpcap, -i, -w, -r, -c, -n, -nn, -v, -vv, -vvv; filtering: host IP, host HOSTNAME, src host, dst host, src port, dst port, port, ip, ip6, udp, tcp, icmp, and, or, not; advanced filtering: proto[expr:size], “tcp[tcpflags] == tcp-syn”, tcp-ack, tcp-fin, tcp-rst, tcp-push; diplsaying packets: -q, -e, -A, -xx, -x | I didn’t remember how to look for a dns query becasue I didn’t remember the port associated with it | I should memorize the most important port numbers |

I used the tool, I really like it. There was ctf like excercise, where I had to look at what port there’s a website, access the website via url and get the flag from it - nice. | Struggled with some ports | Still gotta be memorizing ports |
| 2025-08-16 (60 min) [incomplete] | TryHackMe | Stolen Mount | Forensics | Wireshark | None | So I didn’t finish it. But the things I did - I figured stolen name files from the logs and streams: hidden_stash.zip, secets.png, and stolen password, which was encrypted in md5, I decrypted it using online tool and it was: avengers. I tried copying the contents from the pcapng file and trying to run it, by I don’t know binary that good and it always gave error. | Couldn’t revocer the files just from pcapng file | Gotta learn how to do it properly and then return |
| 2025-08-16 (30 min) | Blue Team Labs Online | Bruteforce | Incident Response | ip-api | T1110 - Brute Force | I analyzed logs from brute force attack. I had to count all the failed login attempts, get what use was attacked, what IP conducted the attack, get in which country this ip is based (I did it with ip-api) and then check what range of ports were attacked. Some minor things as well, but it was all pretty easy to sum it up. Logs looked real btw | I had a problem how to properly count such a huge amount of logs in csv file | Gotta get used to openoffice xml filters |
| 2025-08-16 (30 min) [incomplete] | Blue Team Labs Online | Log Analysis - Compromised WordPress | Incident Response | None | Getting access to website by exploting vuln in a plugin (on wordpress) | I get 6/20 points only. I looked at raw logs straight from txt files. I got exact url of the admin login panel with the token - that’s the way the attacker got control I think. Also I found the name of a PHP web shell file in the logs. That’s it, I will come back when I get more knowledge. | I couldn’t read more in depth stuff: which tools were used, what CVE was the plugin vulnerable to, what plugin was exploted to get access etc | Gotta learn more about access logs |
