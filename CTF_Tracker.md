Also making sure there are relevant policies for people to go by. It all sounds super interesting. And I learned that the projects I do are now making so much more sense. Also - it gave me good ideas for more detection rules in my LogSniper | Nothing really, it was fun and informative | I could write down the theory stuff and try to memorize it more, becasue it sounded useful. Checking real world names for such tools |

| 2025-08-10 (5 min) | picoCTF | FANTASY CTF | Introduction + rules | I used WSL for this | None | Just connecting via command to get a grasp of rules: make only one account, don’t share artifacts, don’t do writeups unless winners are declared. And don’t look for flags outside of scope of ctf of course. | None | None |
| 2025-08-10 (10 min) | picoCTF | WebDecode | Inspecting and decoding | [https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/encode_decode](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/encode_decode) | None | Just got to inspect a webpage and on one of subpages there was a code hidden in some html element. Pasting the code into google search gave me  the encode_decode google app. Decoding the code in base64 gave me the flag. Learned where things might be hidden on the page and that there is a reliable tool for coding/decoding. | I struggled to what to look for at the beginning | None |
| 2025-08-11 (70 min) | TryHackMe | Windows Command Line | cmd.exe | cmd.exe, Linux command line | None | set, ver, systeminfo, more, driverquery | more, help, cls; ipconfig, ipconfig /all, ping target_name, tracert target_name, nslookup target_name, nslookup target_name ip_number, netstat, netstat -h, netstat -abon; cd, dir, dir /a, dir /s, tree, cd, cd target_directory, cd .., mkdir directory_name, rmdir directory_name, type, more, copy, move, del, erase, *; tasklist, /?, tasklist /FI “imagename eq sshd.exe”, taskkill /PID target_pid; BONUS: chkdsk, driverquery, sfc /scannow, shutdown /s | None | Gotta use it in practice |

| 2025-08-11 (30 min) - 37% | TryHackMe | Investigating Windows | Forensics | PowerShell, Event Viewer, Task Scheduler, etc. | It was full on attack, lots of techniques I presume | I did only 37% of tasks, can’t do more right now. But I figured version and year of windows machine from PS. I figured who lat logged on (it was me). And I noticed IP connecting to my machine at the start - it was in cmd on auto-start. Then I checked in Task Scheduler what’s the name of malicious task, what does it do and which port the file listens locally. I checked Event Viewer as well but I couldn’t find any useful information. | I still don’t know how to check when was the last login, how to check when did the compromise take place, what tools were used, how to check for DNS posoning and much more | That CTF was difficult for me. I am glad I did the 37%. I should find something easier or just focus on other material for now |
| 2025-08-12 (60 min) | TryHackMe | Linux Shells | Linux Fundamentals | Bash | None | echo $SHELL, cat /etc/shells, chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh, history, similarities and differences of bash, fish and zsh; .sh, #!/bin/bash, echo, read name, ./, for i in {1..10}; do echo $i done; if else, comments, sudo su. At the end was good practical excercise, to modificate a script and look for a flag | Nothing really | I should compare all 3 CLIs I know right now |
| 2025-08-13 (60 min) | TryHackMe | Networking Concepts | Networking | Bash | None | OSI ISO Model explained once again with some additions; same with TCP/IP model (sometimes it is presented with the fifth layer - physical layer); IP adresses and routing explained once again (there are three ranges of private IP adresses); UDP vs TCP again; encapsulation was more explained - TCP - segment vs UDP - datagram, with example of a life of a packet; using telnetm changing the port | None | I can add new information to the notes |
| 2025-08-13 (60 min) | TryHackMe | Networking Essentials | Networking | None | None | Repeating and expanding information: DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DORA); ARP - Address Resolution Protocol (bridge between second and third layer); ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol (ping, traceroute, tracert - already used those commands); Routing protocols: old ones: OSPF - Open Shortest Path First and RIP - Routing Information protocol; and new ones: EIGRP - Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol and BGP - Border Gateway Protocol; NAT - Network Address Translation: techniaclly it makes power of 2 addresses. Also there were exaples shown in Wireshark, which is nice. | Routing protocols methods - I didn’t memorize them (although it was said those are beyond scope of this room) | I’ll try to understand the protocols while writing notes |
| 2025-08-13 (1 min) | picoCTF | Inspect HTML | Web Exploitation | None | None | I just inspected the page and the flag was in the comments. Easiest flag of my life. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (2 min) | picoCTF | Insp3ct0r | Web Exploitation | None | None | I inspected the page, part 1/3 of the flag was right there in the comments, part 2/3 of the flag was in the CSS file, part 3/3 of the flag was in the JS file. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (10 min) | picoCTF | where are the robots | Web Exploitation | None | I checked the file I wasn’t supposed to, but I didn’t brutecheck it, so I don’t know if it’s classified (Maybe T1594?) | I accessed the file robots.txt by writing it to the url (/robots.txt), there was another link hidden → reaching it has given me a flag | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (5 min) | picoCTF | dont-use-client-side | Web Exploitation | None | None | I inspected the site and found fragmented flag in the code. I put it together and that’s it. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (+30 min) | picoCTF | GET aHEAD | Web Exploitation | WSL | I used a method via bash | The solution was hidden in the name of the challange. I checked on the internet how to use defferent http methods, opened my WSL and used “curl —head site-address”, and got the flag in the terminal. | I struggled with imagining how creative CTFs can be | None |
| 2025-08-13 (3 min) | picoCTF | Includes | Web Exploitation | None | None | Inspected the site, flag was hidden in css file and js file. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (15 min) | picoCTF | Local Authority | Web Exploitation | [hashes.com](http://hashes.com) (wasn’t useful though) | None | The task was to use proper login and password to log in. I had to missinput first, then inspect the page with an alert, then check that in the page there was a fucntion used to check if the credentials are correct, and then get into linked JS file to check what were right credentials. I also learned that how numbers and letters look in ASCII and how to “dehash” - there was hashed successful login information for an admin. I have no clue what was the purpose of it though. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (3 min) | picoCTF | Unminify | Web Exploitation | None | None | So the code of file was just put in one line. I had to scroll to the right to find the flag in the comment. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (3 min) | picoCTF | Bookmarklet | Web Exploitation | [Playcode.io](http://Playcode.io) - just to use their online code editor | None | Copied the code that was in plain sight, opened online JS code editor, pasted it into it, got the flag in an alert. | None | None |
| 2025-08-14 (65 min) | TryHackMe | Networking Core Protocols | Networking | bash, telnet, Wireshark | None | New and old stuff. DNS {TCP/UDP - 23} - Domain Name System: its records: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX. whois. HTTP(S) {TCP - 80 (443)} - Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (Secure): GET, POST, PUT, DELETE; telnet {TCP - 23} GET /file.html HTTP/1.1 Host: anything. FTP {TCP - 21} - File Transfer Protocol: USER, PASS, RETR, STOR. SMTP {TCP - 25} - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol: HELO/EHLO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, DATA, ., .

I didn’t use Wireshark yet, but results of most of the protocols were shown on Wireshark. | I don’t remember all the methods a protocol has | I can revise the methods |
| 2025-08-14 (75 min) | TryHackMe | Networking Secure Protocols | Networking | Wireshark | I checked packets with aquired public key to get credentials (no technique afaik) | Encrypting protocols from the last chapter. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) kinda evolved to TSL (Transport Layer Security). It all took more than 20 years. TLS (like SSL) is working on transport layer; TLS certificate → CSR → CA; Let’s Encrypt. HTTP + TLS → HTTPS; getting encryption key; TLS adds a step between TCP handshake and http communication. HTTPS → 443; SMTPS → 465 and 587; POP3S → 995; IMAPS → 993; telnet → SSH (Secure Shell). SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) → 22; FTPS (File Transef Protocol Secure) → 990; VPN (Virtual Private Network) → mainly data goes through Main Branch VPN Server, bit it can differ. I used Wireshark to check packets, because I had right TLS key. It was very interesting seeing it all in action. It took me a while to find right packet with credentials though. | I don’t remember port numbers | I can revise port numbers |
| 2025-08-14 (110 min) | TryHackMe | Wireshark: The Basics | Tools - Wireshark | Wireshark, bash | None | Use cases of the tool. How the tool look, what type of files does it load (PCAP - Packet Capture), how the coloring works, how to sniff a traffic, how to merge PCAP files, how to view file details. Packet dissection - packet detailes and how they correlate with OSI layers. Packet navigation: packet numbers, go to packet, find packets, mark packets, export packets, export objects (Files), time display format, expert info and its meaning. Packet filtering: apply as filter, conversation filter, colorise conversation, prepare as filter, apply as column and follow stream. The room was very practical, ctf-like excercises. I liked it. It is good to see how the knowledge applies in action. Great tool. | None | I’ll try to use the tool for practical ctf-s |
| 2025-08-14 (80 min) - 81% | TryHackMe | Warzone 1 | Forensics | Wireshark, Brim, Network Miner, VirusTotal | None | I think I could do a writeup. I didn’t finish the room (81%) but I got pretty close. On Brim I checked the signature of malware. Then I got but destination and source IPs of it (wrote it in defanged format), I used VirusTotal to check what group was associated with the malware (TA505), also checked that family of the malware was called MirrorBlast and majority of file types were Windows Installers. Then I used Wireshark to check user-agent of flagged IP address - it was REBOL View 2.7.8.3.1. Then I used Brim again to find 2 adresses that also sent malware. Then I used Brim and Wireshark to check names of the files. At the end I was looking for paths of installation for the files on Wireshark - in binary packets info and streams. I found 2 path files of 4, so it’s not too bad. I am so proud of myself. First big, practical ctf almost done. | I couldn’t find path file names | I should check it out on the internet or ask sb |
| 2025-08-15 (70 min) | TryHackMe | Tcpdump: The Basics | Tools - TcpDump | Tcpdump, bash | None | tcpdump, libpcap, -i, -w, -r, -c, -n, -nn, -v, -vv, -vvv; filtering: host IP, host HOSTNAME, src host, dst host, src port, dst port, port, ip, ip6, udp, tcp, icmp, and, or, not; advanced filtering: proto[expr:size], “tcp[tcpflags] == tcp-syn”, tcp-ack, tcp-fin, tcp-rst, tcp-push; diplsaying packets: -q, -e, -A, -xx, -x | I didn’t remember how to look for a dns query becasue I didn’t remember the port associated with it | I should memorize the most important port numbers |

I used the tool, I really like it. There was ctf like excercise, where I had to look at what port there’s a website, access the website via url and get the flag from it - nice. | Struggled with some ports | Still gotta be memorizing ports |
| 2025-08-16 (60 min) [incomplete] | TryHackMe | Stolen Mount | Forensics | Wireshark | None | So I didn’t finish it. But the things I did - I figured stolen name files from the logs and streams: hidden_stash.zip, secets.png, and stolen password, which was encrypted in md5, I decrypted it using online tool and it was: avengers. I tried copying the contents from the pcapng file and trying to run it, by I don’t know binary that good and it always gave error. | Couldn’t revocer the files just from pcapng file | Gotta learn how to do it properly and then return |
| 2025-08-16 (30 min) | Blue Team Labs Online | Bruteforce | Incident Response | ip-api | T1110 - Brute Force | I analyzed logs from brute force attack. I had to count all the failed login attempts, get what use was attacked, what IP conducted the attack, get in which country this ip is based (I did it with ip-api) and then check what range of ports were attacked. Some minor things as well, but it was all pretty easy to sum it up. Logs looked real btw | I had a problem how to properly count such a huge amount of logs in csv file | Gotta get used to openoffice xml filters |
| 2025-08-16 (30 min) [incomplete] | Blue Team Labs Online | Log Analysis - Compromised WordPress | Incident Response | None | Getting access to website by exploting vuln in a plugin (on wordpress) | I get 6/20 points only. I looked at raw logs straight from txt files. I got exact url of the admin login panel with the token - that’s the way the attacker got control I think. Also I found the name of a PHP web shell file in the logs. That’s it, I will come back when I get more knowledge. | I couldn’t read more in depth stuff: which tools were used, what CVE was the plugin vulnerable to, what plugin was exploted to get access etc | Gotta learn more about access logs |

First I blocked hash of his malware, then I blocked IP I found in the SIEM logs, then I blocked his DNS domain, then he tried to disable realtime monitoring, so I had to block that event with sigma rule focused on sysmon event logs and registery modifications, then I had to use actuall access logs that he sent me and combain them with the logs I had in my SIEM, then I had to block him with sigma rules on web server logs, and at the end I had to block his pricess creation with sigma rules, because he was getting intel and saving it to a hidden log file. I loved how dynamic and rich the scenario was. I can’t wait to play more rooms like that. | It was difficult to get the grasp of what were the exact techniques used, in what category they belong, but I figured it out | I’d love to look for more such scenarios in the future |

| 2025-10-08 (45 min) | CyberDefenders | Red Stealer Lab | Threat Intel | VirusTotal, MITRE ATT&CK, MALWARE bazaar | T1005 | I got SHA-256 hash of the malware file and got to analyze it. I used VirusTotal. I had to find the category of this malware and its name - all of this info on the detection site. Then timestamp of first submission - I found it in detail → history. After that - I had to find MITRE ATT&CK technique in which that malware was used. I used MITRE ATT&CK for it, found relevant options under collection tag and the second option worked (T1005). Then I had to find which social media it was trying to connect → behavior site → HTTP request → FB worked. Then I had to find IP address and port with which malware communicates → behavior → IP traffic. Then I had to find YARA rules → I used MalwareBazaar for it → pasted the hash and found the name of the rule created by exact user. Then by the IP address I found earlier I had to find which malware is associated with the address. Again - I used MalwareBazaar → just pasted the IP in the search and found the name of it. For finding what DLL was used by the malware for privilege escalation I had to → behavior → runtime modules → and brute force the answer | Using that thourougly VirusTotal was a bit hard at the beginning | I would love to make more practical labs as this one |
| 2025-10-09 - 2025-10-10 (90 min) | TryHackMe | Threat Intelligence Tools | Cyber Threat Intelligence | UrlScan.io, Abuse.ch, PhishTool, Cisco Talos Intelligence, WHOIS, VirusTotal | T1566 - Phishing, T1594 - Search Victim-Owned Websites | I got to know and try some tools for CTI. First one was [UrlScan.io](http://UrlScan.io) - a website for scanning and analysing websites. I had to analyze [tryhackme.com](http://tryhackme.com) website and get some basic information about it - its Cisco Umbrella Rank, how many domains was identified with it, main domain registrar and the main IP address. I had to find all the information on the screenshot, but I made the scan myself as well. Then [Abuse.ch](http://Abuse.ch) - a project with many helpful websites: Malware Bazaar (which I actually used yesterday), Feodo Tracker, SSL Blacklist, URL Haus and ThreatFox (which I used yesterday as well). I had to make a search for every excercise here. After that was PhishTool - email analysis tool. I made myself an account and after that made some excercises. For some of the answers I had to look in to a header of an email. After that I familiarized myself with Cisco Talos Intelligence, I had to find listed domain of an IP address, and then I had to find customer name of the IP address (but I used WHOIS for this). After that there were 2 simple scenarios. Basically in both scenarios I had to look at the header of an email, download the attachment, make a md5 hash out of it (with md5sum commend), and use VirusTotal to find some information: specific Detection Alias and a family of the malware. | I had problems finding a header of an email. | I’d love to make more rooms like this one |
| 2025-10-13 (75 min) | TryHackMe | Yara | Cyber Threat Intelligence | VirusTotal, Yara, Loki, yarGen | T1505.003 - Server Software Component: Web Shell | What Yara is, why malware use strings, introduction to yara rules: “yara yararule.yar somefile”. Keywords found in Yara Rules: Desc, Meta, Strings, Conditions, Weight (condition: any of them; filesize); Yara modules: Cuckoo (sandbox - creates Yara rules with the behavior of malware), Python PE; Other Yara Tools: LOKI - free open-source IOC scanner, THOR - multiplatform IOC and YARA scanner, FENRIR - IOC checker, can run on bush, YAYA - tool to manage multiple YARA rule repositories. I had to use Loki to scan files, check which rules were they matching, then had to check their names with hashes on VirusTotal. Turned out one file wasn’t detected with Yara. Si I had to make a rule based on this file with yarGen. I run Yara this time and the file got detected. |  |  |
| 2025-10-29 (45 min) | The Cyber Range | Scanning Windows: Authenticated vs Unauthenticated | Scanning for Vulnerabilities | Azure, Tenable | T1046, T1595 | First I had to make a Windows 10 VM, I logged into it and disabled FW, then I ran this command on the VM: “Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" -Name "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" -Value 1 -Type DWord -Force” so anyone connecting will have administrative privileges, without requiring elevation. Then I logged into Tenable and created Basic Network Scan. I set it for Internal Scanner so I don’t have use outside server for scanning, but without credentials it can simulate scan from the outside. Then I turned on pinging the remote host and using fast network discovery. I left credentials blank, so the scan will be unauthenticated. The whole scan took 11 minutes and found 35 vulnerabilities: 4 medium, 1 low and 30 info level. Most noticable were SSL related (Certificate Cannot Be Trusted; Self-Signed Certificate) and TLS related (Version 1.1 Deprecated Protocol; Version 1.0 Protocol Detection). Then I edited the scan and added credentials for my VM, so the scan became authorized. It took 24 minutes and found 144 vulnerabilities: 3 high, 6 medium, 3 low and 132 info level. The most noticible vulnerabilities were: Security Updates Outlook for Windows (April 2024) (High); Microsoft Teams for Desktop < 25122.1415.3698.6812 Remote Code
Execution (August 2025) (High); WinVerifyTrust Signature Validation CVE-2013-3900 Mitigation
(EnableCertPaddingCheck) (High) and 7-Zip related (<25.00; <24.09 (ZDI-25-045))(Medium). The authenticated scan took so much longer because the scope automatically was much more broad. | Nothing | I will come back to this lab and try to do this without a tutorial |
| 2025-10-29 (30 min) | The Cyber Range | Scanning Linux (Ubuntu): Authenticated vs Unauthenticated | Scanning for Vulnerabilities | Azure, Tenable | T1046, T1595 | First I had to make Linux Ubuntu 22 Virtual Machine, open NSG completely, so all inbound traffic was allowed. I tested connection with a ping and with ssh login. Then I made same basic scan as with Win 11 lab, and took the scan. The unauthenticated scan took only 6 minutes, found 21 vulnerabilities, all info level, except for 1 low, which was ICMP Timestamp Request Remote Data Disclosure. Then I used these commends on the VM “sudo passwd rootsudo grep -q '^PermitRootLogin' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && sudo sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config || echo 'PermitRootLogin yes' | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config > /dev/null && sudo systemctl restart sshd” I made it so the scan could have elevated privileges. I edited the scan, added the credentials and started it. The authenticated scan took 6 minutes as well, found 59 vulnerabilities in total, and the most severe was OpenSSL 3.4.0 < 3.4.3 Multiple Vulnerabilities (Medium). Scans were fast because there weren’t much to scan I presume (in comparison to Windows 11 VMs) | Nothing | I will come back to this lab as well later on |
| 2025-10-29 (60 min) | The Cyber Range | Using a DISA STIG Scan Template | Scanning for Vulnerabilities | Azure, Tenable | T1046 | I created Windows 11 VM, disabled FW, added some additional vulnerabilities for the scan to discover (created an administrator account, set password to “password” with no expiration and added it to “administrators” group and added “guest” account to the “administrators” group). Opened the NSG completely once again, tested connection with a Ping, all worked. I created scan template as an Advanced Network Scan with the following settings checked: Started the Remote Registry service during the scan; enable administrative shares during the scan; start the server service during the scan; ping the remote host; use fast network discovery; network port scanners: TCP; perform thorough tests, but left Only use credentials provided by the user unchecked. I entered the credentials and added compliance DISA Microsoft Windows 11 STIG v2v3. I saved the Template and performed the scan with the template. The scan took 49 minutes and found 144 vulnerabilities in total: 1 critical, 4 high, 6 medium, 3 low and 130 info level. The most severe vulnerabilities were: SQLite < 3.50.2 Memory Corruption (Critical); Security Updates Outlook for Windows (April 2024) (High); Microsoft Teams for Desktop < 25122.1415.3698.6812 Remote Code
Execution (August 2025) (High); WinVerifyTrust Signature Validation CVE-2013-3900 Mitigation
(EnableCertPaddingCheck) (High); SQLite 3.44.0 < 3.49.1 Multiple Vulnerabilities (High). The scan found a lot, but it was thorough as well. | It just took a lot of time and I didn’t expect that (but hey, that’s how it is, better get used to it) | I will come back here again |
| 2025-10-29 (60 min) | The Cyber Range | Agent Based Monitoring: Windows | Scanning for Vulnerabilities | Azure, Tenable | None (the scan was authorized) | So I made Win 11 VM, in Tennable created an Agent Group, created Basic Agent Scan, triggered by the file start.txt deployed in the right folder. Then I logged into the VM, went into Tenable again and took code to make a Nessus Agent, pasted it into powershell: “Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "[https://sensor.cloud.tenable.com/install/agent/installer/ms-install-script.ps1](https://sensor.cloud.tenable.com/install/agent/installer/ms-install-script.ps1)" -OutFile "./ms-install-script.ps1"; & "./ms-install-script.ps1" -key "xxx" -type "agent" -name "<agent name here>" -groups '<group name here>'; Remove-Item -Path "./ms-install-script.ps1"”. Then I had to wait for a bit to end Nessus Agent installation. After that I wenr into the right folder (C:\programdata\tenable\nessus_agent\nessus\triggers) and deployed the file (start.txt). It took a while for nessus to actually delete the file and start the scan. The whole scan took probably 45-60 minutes, I didn’t count it though. The scan found 118 vulnerabilities: 3 high, 2 medium, 2 low and 110 info level. The most severe were: WinVerifyTrust Signature Validation CVE-2013-3900 Mitigation (EnableCertPaddingCheck) (8.8 CVSS3); Security Updates Outlook for Windows (April 2024) (8.1 CVSS3); Microsoft Teams for Desktop < 25122.1415.3698.6812 Remote Code Execution (August 2025) (7.5 CVSS3) | It took even more time, but it just shows how important are regular scans, and not just randomly triggered by strange triggers | I will do it again later |
| 2025-10-30 (60 min) | The Cyber Range | Agent Based Monitoring: Linux | Scanning for Vulnerabilities | Azure, Tenable | None (the scan was authorized) | I made Linux Ubuntu 22 VM, made an agent group, made a basic agent scan, added it to the group and truned on triggering by start.txt file. On Tenable I took the code for installing an agent: “curl -H 'X-Key: xxx' 'https://sensor.cloud.tenable.com/install/agent?name=agent-name&groups=agent-group' | bash”, changed agent-name and agent-group to my own, logged into the VM with ssh, wrote sudo -i and pasted and run the code I took earlier from Tenable. After installing I went to trigger location (/opt/nessus_agent/var/nessus/triggers) and made the file. The agent didn’t worked properly for quite some time (I checked resources with ‘top’ and it didn’t use them properly). I tried restaring the service with “sudo systemctl restart nessusagent.service” but it didn’t help. Somehow the VM stopped working, Tenable showed that the agent is bugged because of this, but I turned the VM on and it somehow started working properly. 20 minutes later the results were on my Tenable. So the scan found 43 info level vulns and 1 medium (OpenSSL 3.4.0 < 3.4.3 Multiple Vulnerabilities). (5.9 CVSS3 base score) | I couldn’t get the agent working, next time I’ll try to reset the VM much faster. | I will do this lab again |
| 2025-10-30 (20 min) | The Cyber Range | Discovery Scan: Entire Subnet | Scanning for Vulnerabilities | Azure, Tenable | None (the scan was authorized) | I went to Tenable to create a Host Discovery Scan, I took our Subnet IP range from Azure and put it into the scan and just ran the scan. It took 10 minutes and there were only 2 assets found unfortunately. If I didn’t know them I would figure out who is the owner and tag them accordingly. | None | I will do this lab again |
| 2025-10-30 (180 min) | The Cyber Range | Manual Vulnerability Remediation on Windows | Vulnerability Remidiation | Azure, Tenable | None (the scan was authorized) | I made a Windows 10 VM, disabled FW, just in case opened all ports and run a commend to automatically give administrative privileges to users who connect remtely to the VM. I did authorized scan with an internal scanner. The first one took me 43 minutes and found 147 vulnerabilities in total (1 ciritcal, 4 high, 6 medium, 3 low and 133 info level). Then I logged into the machine and enabled SMBv1 and installed a very outdated firefox. I restarted the VM and run another authenticated scan. This one took 39 minutes and found 207 total vulnerabilities (30(!) critical, 16 high, 14 medium, 4 low and 143 info level). Most of the new important vulnerabilities were present because of the firefox version. After that I run some windows updates on the VM, disabled SMBv1 and uninstalled the firefox and run yet another authentication scan. This one took 37 minutes and found 156 vulnerabilities (1 critical, 4 high, 6 medium, 3 low and 142 info level). The third scan had more info vulnerabilities because of the windows updates I ran. If I really wanted to mitigate as many vulnerabilities as possible I would have to update SQLite, Outlook, Microsoft Teams and 7-Zip, because those apps gave the most severe vulnerabilities, but that wasn’t the goal of the lab. | I had a lot of problems with this lab, because 4 first scans didn’t work, I had to figure some stuff out on my own. I opened ports for all incoming traffic and apparently it worked but shouldn’t (?) because the scan was internal. But I am glad it worked. Oh and waiting for the scans took a lot of time as well. | I will do this lab again |
| 2025-10-30 (50 min) | The Cyber Range | Manual Vulnerability Remediation on Linux | Vulnerability Remidiation | Azure, Tenable | None (the scan was authorized) | I made a Linux Ubuntu 22 Server VM, created an authenticated scan in Tenable, based off a User Defined Template (DISA/STIG), chose Internal Scanner and scanned the VM. The scan took 13 minutes and found 61 vulnerabilities in total (1 low and 60 info level). The one was ICMP Timestamp Request Remote Date Disclosure, which I believe shows local datetime of the machine if you ping it, if I am not mistaken. After that I had to connect to the VM through ssh, and I forgot to turn on public IP, so I deleted the VM and made a new one. On the new VM I installed telnet (sudo apt install telnetd -y) and startend inet service (sudo systemctl start inted.service). Then I enabled root account on the VM and allowed ssh login with root (sudo grep -q '^PermitRootLogin' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && sudo sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config || echo 'PermitRootLogin yes' | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config && sudo systemctl restart sshd) and changed the password of the root to root (sudo passwd root → root  → root) (which isn’t safe of course, so I tried to do the lab asap).  I ran authenticates scan again, which took 12 minutes and found 65 vulnerabilities total (2 high, 1 medium, 1 low and 61 info level). Then I remidiated the vulnerabilities: I disabled the inet, purged telnet and changed the root password for a more complex one. The third scan was the same as the second one. | I think I messed up the commands, and new vulns happen because of making VM with public IP this time. But I got the idea of how it should look. | I will do the lab again, but first I will focus on labs with actual full remidiation. |
| 2025-10-31 (120 minutes) | The Cyber Range | Programmatic Remediation in Windows | Vulnerability Remidiation | Azure, Tenable, github | None (the scan was authorized) | I made Windows 11 VM, logged in and turned of the FW and allowed local accounts to connect remotely with full admin privileges with the PS command I used in earlier labs. On the VM I installed an old version of Wireshark, enabled SMB v1 and enables discouraged cryptographic protocols (SSL 2.0, 3.0 and TLS 1.0, 1.1) with a trusted powershell script I got from github and run it with PS ISE. I restarted the VM and run an authenticated scan. The scan took 41 minutes and found 178 vulnerabilities in total (3 critical, 12 high, 15 medium, 3 low and 145 info level). The most critical ones Wireshark have us (it even had multiple DoS Vulnerabilities), SMB one. After that I got more scripts from the github, this time for remidiation and I ran all of them (for Wireshark, SMBv1 and for discoureged cryptographic protocols) in PS ISE. I restarted the VM and ran an authenticated scan again. This time the duration of the scan was equal to 42 minutes and it found 155 vulnerabilities in total (1 critical, 4 high, 4 medium, 3 low and 143 info level). | I couldn’t connect to the VM after restarting it, and it happened 2-3 times. I figured bastion from azure was probably at fault, so I just made a VM with public IP this time and connected to it with remote desktop control. It worked. | I will do this lab again |
| 2025-10-31 (80 minutes) | The Cyber Range | Programmatic Remediation in Linux | Vulnerability Remidiation | Azure, Tenable, github | None (the scan was authorized) | I made Linux Ubuntu 22 VM, I turend it on and logged into it through SSH, I enabled root account logging through ssh, took the credential, put them into a scan and ran the scan. It took 11 minutes, found 66 vulnerabilities in total (1 critical, 1 medium, 1 low and 63 info level). The critical one is root accounts password set to root (my bad), and the medium one was Open SSL version with multiple vulnerabilities. So I got into the VM and installed and enabled telnet. This time the scan took 28 minutes and found 69 vulnerabilities in total (1 critical, 2 medium, 1 low and 65 info level). New medium one is the unencrypted telnet server. After that I got from github some remediation bash scripts - to change default root password, to remediate OpenSSL version and to remediate Telnet. I ran them all basically with this process: I get the raw code with wget, I make the file executable with chmod +x and then I run the script with ./name-of-the-script command. The files were autodeleting themselves, 1 time I had to ignore certificate for 1 script, and for the other I had to log in again, because it was rebooting at the end of the script. I changed new credentials of the root account in the scan and ran it again. It took 23 minutes and found 63 vulnerabilities in total (1 low and 62 info level). I got rid basically of everything important to the point where I wasn’t sure I accidently didn’t make an unauthorized scan, but checked some info vulns and it turned out we are just fine. | At the beginning I ran unauthorized scan, because I forgot I have to give the scanner more authorization, so I had to do this again. | I will do this lab again |
