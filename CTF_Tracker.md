Also making sure there are relevant policies for people to go by. It all sounds super interesting. And I learned that the projects I do are now making so much more sense. Also - it gave me good ideas for more detection rules in my LogSniper | Nothing really, it was fun and informative | I could write down the theory stuff and try to memorize it more, becasue it sounded useful. Checking real world names for such tools |

| 2025-08-10 (5 min) | picoCTF | FANTASY CTF | Introduction + rules | I used WSL for this | None | Just connecting via command to get a grasp of rules: make only one account, don’t share artifacts, don’t do writeups unless winners are declared. And don’t look for flags outside of scope of ctf of course. | None | None |
| 2025-08-10 (10 min) | picoCTF | WebDecode | Inspecting and decoding | [https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/encode_decode](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/encode_decode) | None | Just got to inspect a webpage and on one of subpages there was a code hidden in some html element. Pasting the code into google search gave me  the encode_decode google app. Decoding the code in base64 gave me the flag. Learned where things might be hidden on the page and that there is a reliable tool for coding/decoding. | I struggled to what to look for at the beginning | None |
| 2025-08-11 (70 min) | TryHackMe | Windows Command Line | cmd.exe | cmd.exe, Linux command line | None | set, ver, systeminfo, more, driverquery | more, help, cls; ipconfig, ipconfig /all, ping target_name, tracert target_name, nslookup target_name, nslookup target_name ip_number, netstat, netstat -h, netstat -abon; cd, dir, dir /a, dir /s, tree, cd, cd target_directory, cd .., mkdir directory_name, rmdir directory_name, type, more, copy, move, del, erase, *; tasklist, /?, tasklist /FI “imagename eq sshd.exe”, taskkill /PID target_pid; BONUS: chkdsk, driverquery, sfc /scannow, shutdown /s | None | Gotta use it in practice |

| 2025-08-11 (30 min) - 37% | TryHackMe | Investigating Windows | Forensics | PowerShell, Event Viewer, Task Scheduler, etc. | It was full on attack, lots of techniques I presume | I did only 37% of tasks, can’t do more right now. But I figured version and year of windows machine from PS. I figured who lat logged on (it was me). And I noticed IP connecting to my machine at the start - it was in cmd on auto-start. Then I checked in Task Scheduler what’s the name of malicious task, what does it do and which port the file listens locally. I checked Event Viewer as well but I couldn’t find any useful information. | I still don’t know how to check when was the last login, how to check when did the compromise take place, what tools were used, how to check for DNS posoning and much more | That CTF was difficult for me. I am glad I did the 37%. I should find something easier or just focus on other material for now |
| 2025-08-12 (60 min) | TryHackMe | Linux Shells | Linux Fundamentals | Bash | None | echo $SHELL, cat /etc/shells, chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh, history, similarities and differences of bash, fish and zsh; .sh, #!/bin/bash, echo, read name, ./, for i in {1..10}; do echo $i done; if else, comments, sudo su. At the end was good practical excercise, to modificate a script and look for a flag | Nothing really | I should compare all 3 CLIs I know right now |
| 2025-08-13 (60 min) | TryHackMe | Networking Concepts | Networking | Bash | None | OSI ISO Model explained once again with some additions; same with TCP/IP model (sometimes it is presented with the fifth layer - physical layer); IP adresses and routing explained once again (there are three ranges of private IP adresses); UDP vs TCP again; encapsulation was more explained - TCP - segment vs UDP - datagram, with example of a life of a packet; using telnetm changing the port | None | I can add new information to the notes |
| 2025-08-13 (60 min) | TryHackMe | Networking Essentials | Networking | None | None | Repeating and expanding information: DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DORA); ARP - Address Resolution Protocol (bridge between second and third layer); ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol (ping, traceroute, tracert - already used those commands); Routing protocols: old ones: OSPF - Open Shortest Path First and RIP - Routing Information protocol; and new ones: EIGRP - Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol and BGP - Border Gateway Protocol; NAT - Network Address Translation: techniaclly it makes power of 2 addresses. Also there were exaples shown in Wireshark, which is nice. | Routing protocols methods - I didn’t memorize them (although it was said those are beyond scope of this room) | I’ll try to understand the protocols while writing notes |
| 2025-08-13 (1 min) | picoCTF | Inspect HTML | Web Exploitation | None | None | I just inspected the page and the flag was in the comments. Easiest flag of my life. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (2 min) | picoCTF | Insp3ct0r | Web Exploitation | None | None | I inspected the page, part 1/3 of the flag was right there in the comments, part 2/3 of the flag was in the CSS file, part 3/3 of the flag was in the JS file. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (10 min) | picoCTF | where are the robots | Web Exploitation | None | I checked the file I wasn’t supposed to, but I didn’t brutecheck it, so I don’t know if it’s classified (Maybe T1594?) | I accessed the file robots.txt by writing it to the url (/robots.txt), there was another link hidden → reaching it has given me a flag | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (5 min) | picoCTF | dont-use-client-side | Web Exploitation | None | None | I inspected the site and found fragmented flag in the code. I put it together and that’s it. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (+30 min) | picoCTF | GET aHEAD | Web Exploitation | WSL | I used a method via bash | The solution was hidden in the name of the challange. I checked on the internet how to use defferent http methods, opened my WSL and used “curl —head site-address”, and got the flag in the terminal. | I struggled with imagining how creative CTFs can be | None |
| 2025-08-13 (3 min) | picoCTF | Includes | Web Exploitation | None | None | Inspected the site, flag was hidden in css file and js file. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (15 min) | picoCTF | Local Authority | Web Exploitation | [hashes.com](http://hashes.com) (wasn’t useful though) | None | The task was to use proper login and password to log in. I had to missinput first, then inspect the page with an alert, then check that in the page there was a fucntion used to check if the credentials are correct, and then get into linked JS file to check what were right credentials. I also learned that how numbers and letters look in ASCII and how to “dehash” - there was hashed successful login information for an admin. I have no clue what was the purpose of it though. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (3 min) | picoCTF | Unminify | Web Exploitation | None | None | So the code of file was just put in one line. I had to scroll to the right to find the flag in the comment. | None | None |
| 2025-08-13 (3 min) | picoCTF | Bookmarklet | Web Exploitation | [Playcode.io](http://Playcode.io) - just to use their online code editor | None | Copied the code that was in plain sight, opened online JS code editor, pasted it into it, got the flag in an alert. | None | None |
| 2025-08-14 (65 min) | TryHackMe | Networking Core Protocols | Networking | bash, telnet, Wireshark | None | New and old stuff. DNS {TCP/UDP - 23} - Domain Name System: its records: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX. whois. HTTP(S) {TCP - 80 (443)} - Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (Secure): GET, POST, PUT, DELETE; telnet {TCP - 23} GET /file.html HTTP/1.1 Host: anything. FTP {TCP - 21} - File Transfer Protocol: USER, PASS, RETR, STOR. SMTP {TCP - 25} - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol: HELO/EHLO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, DATA, ., .

I didn’t use Wireshark yet, but results of most of the protocols were shown on Wireshark. | I don’t remember all the methods a protocol has | I can revise the methods |
| 2025-08-14 (75 min) | TryHackMe | Networking Secure Protocols | Networking | Wireshark | I checked packets with aquired public key to get credentials (no technique afaik) | Encrypting protocols from the last chapter. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) kinda evolved to TSL (Transport Layer Security). It all took more than 20 years. TLS (like SSL) is working on transport layer; TLS certificate → CSR → CA; Let’s Encrypt. HTTP + TLS → HTTPS; getting encryption key; TLS adds a step between TCP handshake and http communication. HTTPS → 443; SMTPS → 465 and 587; POP3S → 995; IMAPS → 993; telnet → SSH (Secure Shell). SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) → 22; FTPS (File Transef Protocol Secure) → 990; VPN (Virtual Private Network) → mainly data goes through Main Branch VPN Server, bit it can differ. I used Wireshark to check packets, because I had right TLS key. It was very interesting seeing it all in action. It took me a while to find right packet with credentials though. | I don’t remember port numbers | I can revise port numbers |
| 2025-08-14 (110 min) | TryHackMe | Wireshark: The Basics | Tools - Wireshark | Wireshark, bash | None | Use cases of the tool. How the tool look, what type of files does it load (PCAP - Packet Capture), how the coloring works, how to sniff a traffic, how to merge PCAP files, how to view file details. Packet dissection - packet detailes and how they correlate with OSI layers. Packet navigation: packet numbers, go to packet, find packets, mark packets, export packets, export objects (Files), time display format, expert info and its meaning. Packet filtering: apply as filter, conversation filter, colorise conversation, prepare as filter, apply as column and follow stream. The room was very practical, ctf-like excercises. I liked it. It is good to see how the knowledge applies in action. Great tool. | None | I’ll try to use the tool for practical ctf-s |
| 2025-08-14 (80 min) - 81% | TryHackMe | Warzone 1 | Forensics | Wireshark, Brim, Network Miner, VirusTotal | None | I think I could do a writeup. I didn’t finish the room (81%) but I got pretty close. On Brim I checked the signature of malware. Then I got but destination and source IPs of it (wrote it in defanged format), I used VirusTotal to check what group was associated with the malware (TA505), also checked that family of the malware was called MirrorBlast and majority of file types were Windows Installers. Then I used Wireshark to check user-agent of flagged IP address - it was REBOL View 2.7.8.3.1. Then I used Brim again to find 2 adresses that also sent malware. Then I used Brim and Wireshark to check names of the files. At the end I was looking for paths of installation for the files on Wireshark - in binary packets info and streams. I found 2 path files of 4, so it’s not too bad. I am so proud of myself. First big, practical ctf almost done. | I couldn’t find path file names | I should check it out on the internet or ask sb |
| 2025-08-15 (70 min) | TryHackMe | Tcpdump: The Basics | Tools - TcpDump | Tcpdump, bash | None | tcpdump, libpcap, -i, -w, -r, -c, -n, -nn, -v, -vv, -vvv; filtering: host IP, host HOSTNAME, src host, dst host, src port, dst port, port, ip, ip6, udp, tcp, icmp, and, or, not; advanced filtering: proto[expr:size], “tcp[tcpflags] == tcp-syn”, tcp-ack, tcp-fin, tcp-rst, tcp-push; diplsaying packets: -q, -e, -A, -xx, -x | I didn’t remember how to look for a dns query becasue I didn’t remember the port associated with it | I should memorize the most important port numbers |

I used the tool, I really like it. There was ctf like excercise, where I had to look at what port there’s a website, access the website via url and get the flag from it - nice. | Struggled with some ports | Still gotta be memorizing ports |
| 2025-08-16 (60 min) [incomplete] | TryHackMe | Stolen Mount | Forensics | Wireshark | None | So I didn’t finish it. But the things I did - I figured stolen name files from the logs and streams: hidden_stash.zip, secets.png, and stolen password, which was encrypted in md5, I decrypted it using online tool and it was: avengers. I tried copying the contents from the pcapng file and trying to run it, by I don’t know binary that good and it always gave error. | Couldn’t revocer the files just from pcapng file | Gotta learn how to do it properly and then return |
| 2025-08-16 (30 min) | Blue Team Labs Online | Bruteforce | Incident Response | ip-api | T1110 - Brute Force | I analyzed logs from brute force attack. I had to count all the failed login attempts, get what use was attacked, what IP conducted the attack, get in which country this ip is based (I did it with ip-api) and then check what range of ports were attacked. Some minor things as well, but it was all pretty easy to sum it up. Logs looked real btw | I had a problem how to properly count such a huge amount of logs in csv file | Gotta get used to openoffice xml filters |
| 2025-08-16 (30 min) [incomplete] | Blue Team Labs Online | Log Analysis - Compromised WordPress | Incident Response | None | Getting access to website by exploting vuln in a plugin (on wordpress) | I get 6/20 points only. I looked at raw logs straight from txt files. I got exact url of the admin login panel with the token - that’s the way the attacker got control I think. Also I found the name of a PHP web shell file in the logs. That’s it, I will come back when I get more knowledge. | I couldn’t read more in depth stuff: which tools were used, what CVE was the plugin vulnerable to, what plugin was exploted to get access etc | Gotta learn more about access logs |

First I blocked hash of his malware, then I blocked IP I found in the SIEM logs, then I blocked his DNS domain, then he tried to disable realtime monitoring, so I had to block that event with sigma rule focused on sysmon event logs and registery modifications, then I had to use actuall access logs that he sent me and combain them with the logs I had in my SIEM, then I had to block him with sigma rules on web server logs, and at the end I had to block his pricess creation with sigma rules, because he was getting intel and saving it to a hidden log file. I loved how dynamic and rich the scenario was. I can’t wait to play more rooms like that. | It was difficult to get the grasp of what were the exact techniques used, in what category they belong, but I figured it out | I’d love to look for more such scenarios in the future |

| 2025-10-08 (45 min) | CyberDefenders | Red Stealer Lab | Threat Intel | VirusTotal, MITRE ATT&CK, MALWARE bazaar | T1005 | I got SHA-256 hash of the malware file and got to analyze it. I used VirusTotal. I had to find the category of this malware and its name - all of this info on the detection site. Then timestamp of first submission - I found it in detail → history. After that - I had to find MITRE ATT&CK technique in which that malware was used. I used MITRE ATT&CK for it, found relevant options under collection tag and the second option worked (T1005). Then I had to find which social media it was trying to connect → behavior site → HTTP request → FB worked. Then I had to find IP address and port with which malware communicates → behavior → IP traffic. Then I had to find YARA rules → I used MalwareBazaar for it → pasted the hash and found the name of the rule created by exact user. Then by the IP address I found earlier I had to find which malware is associated with the address. Again - I used MalwareBazaar → just pasted the IP in the search and found the name of it. For finding what DLL was used by the malware for privilege escalation I had to → behavior → runtime modules → and brute force the answer | Using that thourougly VirusTotal was a bit hard at the beginning | I would love to make more practical labs as this one |
| 2025-10-09 - 2025-10-10 (90 min) | TryHackMe | Threat Intelligence Tools | Cyber Threat Intelligence | UrlScan.io, Abuse.ch, PhishTool, Cisco Talos Intelligence, WHOIS, VirusTotal | T1566 - Phishing, T1594 - Search Victim-Owned Websites | I got to know and try some tools for CTI. First one was [UrlScan.io](http://UrlScan.io) - a website for scanning and analysing websites. I had to analyze [tryhackme.com](http://tryhackme.com) website and get some basic information about it - its Cisco Umbrella Rank, how many domains was identified with it, main domain registrar and the main IP address. I had to find all the information on the screenshot, but I made the scan myself as well. Then [Abuse.ch](http://Abuse.ch) - a project with many helpful websites: Malware Bazaar (which I actually used yesterday), Feodo Tracker, SSL Blacklist, URL Haus and ThreatFox (which I used yesterday as well). I had to make a search for every excercise here. After that was PhishTool - email analysis tool. I made myself an account and after that made some excercises. For some of the answers I had to look in to a header of an email. After that I familiarized myself with Cisco Talos Intelligence, I had to find listed domain of an IP address, and then I had to find customer name of the IP address (but I used WHOIS for this). After that there were 2 simple scenarios. Basically in both scenarios I had to look at the header of an email, download the attachment, make a md5 hash out of it (with md5sum commend), and use VirusTotal to find some information: specific Detection Alias and a family of the malware. | I had problems finding a header of an email. | I’d love to make more rooms like this one |
| 2025-10-13 (75 min) | TryHackMe | Yara | Cyber Threat Intelligence | VirusTotal, Yara, Loki, yarGen | T1505.003 - Server Software Component: Web Shell | What Yara is, why malware use strings, introduction to yara rules: “yara yararule.yar somefile”. Keywords found in Yara Rules: Desc, Meta, Strings, Conditions, Weight (condition: any of them; filesize); Yara modules: Cuckoo (sandbox - creates Yara rules with the behavior of malware), Python PE; Other Yara Tools: LOKI - free open-source IOC scanner, THOR - multiplatform IOC and YARA scanner, FENRIR - IOC checker, can run on bush, YAYA - tool to manage multiple YARA rule repositories. I had to use Loki to scan files, check which rules were they matching, then had to check their names with hashes on VirusTotal. Turned out one file wasn’t detected with Yara. Si I had to make a rule based on this file with yarGen. I run Yara this time and the file got detected. |  |  |
| 2025-10-29 (45 min) | The Cyber Range | Scanning Windows: Authenticated vs Unauthenticated | Scanning for Vulnerabilities | Azure, Tenable | T1046, T1595 | First I had to make a Windows 10 VM, I logged into it and disabled FW, then I ran this command on the VM: “Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" -Name "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" -Value 1 -Type DWord -Force” so anyone connecting will have administrative privileges, without requiring elevation. Then I logged into Tenable and created Basic Network Scan. I set it for Internal Scanner so I don’t have use outside server for scanning, but without credentials it can simulate scan from the outside. Then I turned on pinging the remote host and using fast network discovery. I left credentials blank, so the scan will be unauthenticated. The whole scan took 11 minutes and found 35 vulnerabilities: 4 medium, 1 low and 30 info level. Most noticable were SSL related (Certificate Cannot Be Trusted; Self-Signed Certificate) and TLS related (Version 1.1 Deprecated Protocol; Version 1.0 Protocol Detection). Then I edited the scan and added credentials for my VM, so the scan became authorized. It took 24 minutes and found 144 vulnerabilities: 3 high, 6 medium, 3 low and 132 info level. The most noticible vulnerabilities were: Security Updates Outlook for Windows (April 2024) (High); Microsoft Teams for Desktop < 25122.1415.3698.6812 Remote Code
Execution (August 2025) (High); WinVerifyTrust Signature Validation CVE-2013-3900 Mitigation
(EnableCertPaddingCheck) (High) and 7-Zip related (<25.00; <24.09 (ZDI-25-045))(Medium). The authenticated scan took so much longer because the scope automatically was much more broad. | Nothing | I will come back to this lab and try to do this without a tutorial |
| 2025-10-29 (30 min) | The Cyber Range | Scanning Linux (Ubuntu): Authenticated vs Unauthenticated | Scanning for Vulnerabilities | Azure, Tenable | T1046, T1595 | First I had to make Linux Ubuntu 22 Virtual Machine, open NSG completely, so all inbound traffic was allowed. I tested connection with a ping and with ssh login. Then I made same basic scan as with Win 11 lab, and took the scan. The unauthenticated scan took only 6 minutes, found 21 vulnerabilities, all info level, except for 1 low, which was ICMP Timestamp Request Remote Data Disclosure. Then I used these commends on the VM “sudo passwd rootsudo grep -q '^PermitRootLogin' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && sudo sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config || echo 'PermitRootLogin yes' | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config > /dev/null && sudo systemctl restart sshd” I made it so the scan could have elevated privileges. I edited the scan, added the credentials and started it. The authenticated scan took 6 minutes as well, found 59 vulnerabilities in total, and the most severe was OpenSSL 3.4.0 < 3.4.3 Multiple Vulnerabilities (Medium). Scans were fast because there weren’t much to scan I presume (in comparison to Windows 11 VMs) | Nothing | I will come back to this lab as well later on |
| 2025-10-29 (60 min) | The Cyber Range | Using a DISA STIG Scan Template | Scanning for Vulnerabilities | Azure, Tenable | T1046 | I created Windows 11 VM, disabled FW, added some additional vulnerabilities for the scan to discover (created an administrator account, set password to “password” with no expiration and added it to “administrators” group and added “guest” account to the “administrators” group). Opened the NSG completely once again, tested connection with a Ping, all worked. I created scan template as an Advanced Network Scan with the following settings checked: Started the Remote Registry service during the scan; enable administrative shares during the scan; start the server service during the scan; ping the remote host; use fast network discovery; network port scanners: TCP; perform thorough tests, but left Only use credentials provided by the user unchecked. I entered the credentials and added compliance DISA Microsoft Windows 11 STIG v2v3. I saved the Template and performed the scan with the template. The scan took 49 minutes and found 144 vulnerabilities in total: 1 critical, 4 high, 6 medium, 3 low and 130 info level. The most severe vulnerabilities were: SQLite < 3.50.2 Memory Corruption (Critical); Security Updates Outlook for Windows (April 2024) (High); Microsoft Teams for Desktop < 25122.1415.3698.6812 Remote Code
Execution (August 2025) (High); WinVerifyTrust Signature Validation CVE-2013-3900 Mitigation
(EnableCertPaddingCheck) (High); SQLite 3.44.0 < 3.49.1 Multiple Vulnerabilities (High). The scan found a lot, but it was thorough as well. | It just took a lot of time and I didn’t expect that (but hey, that’s how it is, better get used to it) | I will come back here again |
| 2025-10-29 (60 min) | The Cyber Range | Agent Based Monitoring: Windows | Scanning for Vulnerabilities | Azure, Tenable | None (the scan was authorized) | So I made Win 11 VM, in Tennable created an Agent Group, created Basic Agent Scan, triggered by the file start.txt deployed in the right folder. Then I logged into the VM, went into Tenable again and took code to make a Nessus Agent, pasted it into powershell: “Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "[https://sensor.cloud.tenable.com/install/agent/installer/ms-install-script.ps1](https://sensor.cloud.tenable.com/install/agent/installer/ms-install-script.ps1)" -OutFile "./ms-install-script.ps1"; & "./ms-install-script.ps1" -key "xxx" -type "agent" -name "<agent name here>" -groups '<group name here>'; Remove-Item -Path "./ms-install-script.ps1"”. Then I had to wait for a bit to end Nessus Agent installation. After that I wenr into the right folder (C:\programdata\tenable\nessus_agent\nessus\triggers) and deployed the file (start.txt). It took a while for nessus to actually delete the file and start the scan. The whole scan took probably 45-60 minutes, I didn’t count it though. The scan found 118 vulnerabilities: 3 high, 2 medium, 2 low and 110 info level. The most severe were: WinVerifyTrust Signature Validation CVE-2013-3900 Mitigation (EnableCertPaddingCheck) (8.8 CVSS3); Security Updates Outlook for Windows (April 2024) (8.1 CVSS3); Microsoft Teams for Desktop < 25122.1415.3698.6812 Remote Code Execution (August 2025) (7.5 CVSS3) | It took even more time, but it just shows how important are regular scans, and not just randomly triggered by strange triggers | I will do it again later |
| 2025-10-30 (60 min) | The Cyber Range | Agent Based Monitoring: Linux | Scanning for Vulnerabilities | Azure, Tenable | None (the scan was authorized) | I made Linux Ubuntu 22 VM, made an agent group, made a basic agent scan, added it to the group and truned on triggering by start.txt file. On Tenable I took the code for installing an agent: “curl -H 'X-Key: xxx' 'https://sensor.cloud.tenable.com/install/agent?name=agent-name&groups=agent-group' | bash”, changed agent-name and agent-group to my own, logged into the VM with ssh, wrote sudo -i and pasted and run the code I took earlier from Tenable. After installing I went to trigger location (/opt/nessus_agent/var/nessus/triggers) and made the file. The agent didn’t worked properly for quite some time (I checked resources with ‘top’ and it didn’t use them properly). I tried restaring the service with “sudo systemctl restart nessusagent.service” but it didn’t help. Somehow the VM stopped working, Tenable showed that the agent is bugged because of this, but I turned the VM on and it somehow started working properly. 20 minutes later the results were on my Tenable. So the scan found 43 info level vulns and 1 medium (OpenSSL 3.4.0 < 3.4.3 Multiple Vulnerabilities). (5.9 CVSS3 base score) | I couldn’t get the agent working, next time I’ll try to reset the VM much faster. | I will do this lab again |
| 2025-10-30 (20 min) | The Cyber Range | Discovery Scan: Entire Subnet | Scanning for Vulnerabilities | Azure, Tenable | None (the scan was authorized) | I went to Tenable to create a Host Discovery Scan, I took our Subnet IP range from Azure and put it into the scan and just ran the scan. It took 10 minutes and there were only 2 assets found unfortunately. If I didn’t know them I would figure out who is the owner and tag them accordingly. | None | I will do this lab again |
| 2025-10-30 (180 min) | The Cyber Range | Manual Vulnerability Remediation on Windows | Vulnerability Remidiation | Azure, Tenable | None (the scan was authorized) | I made a Windows 10 VM, disabled FW, just in case opened all ports and run a commend to automatically give administrative privileges to users who connect remtely to the VM. I did authorized scan with an internal scanner. The first one took me 43 minutes and found 147 vulnerabilities in total (1 ciritcal, 4 high, 6 medium, 3 low and 133 info level). Then I logged into the machine and enabled SMBv1 and installed a very outdated firefox. I restarted the VM and run another authenticated scan. This one took 39 minutes and found 207 total vulnerabilities (30(!) critical, 16 high, 14 medium, 4 low and 143 info level). Most of the new important vulnerabilities were present because of the firefox version. After that I run some windows updates on the VM, disabled SMBv1 and uninstalled the firefox and run yet another authentication scan. This one took 37 minutes and found 156 vulnerabilities (1 critical, 4 high, 6 medium, 3 low and 142 info level). The third scan had more info vulnerabilities because of the windows updates I ran. If I really wanted to mitigate as many vulnerabilities as possible I would have to update SQLite, Outlook, Microsoft Teams and 7-Zip, because those apps gave the most severe vulnerabilities, but that wasn’t the goal of the lab. | I had a lot of problems with this lab, because 4 first scans didn’t work, I had to figure some stuff out on my own. I opened ports for all incoming traffic and apparently it worked but shouldn’t (?) because the scan was internal. But I am glad it worked. Oh and waiting for the scans took a lot of time as well. | I will do this lab again |
| 2025-10-30 (50 min) | The Cyber Range | Manual Vulnerability Remediation on Linux | Vulnerability Remidiation | Azure, Tenable | None (the scan was authorized) | I made a Linux Ubuntu 22 Server VM, created an authenticated scan in Tenable, based off a User Defined Template (DISA/STIG), chose Internal Scanner and scanned the VM. The scan took 13 minutes and found 61 vulnerabilities in total (1 low and 60 info level). The one was ICMP Timestamp Request Remote Date Disclosure, which I believe shows local datetime of the machine if you ping it, if I am not mistaken. After that I had to connect to the VM through ssh, and I forgot to turn on public IP, so I deleted the VM and made a new one. On the new VM I installed telnet (sudo apt install telnetd -y) and startend inet service (sudo systemctl start inted.service). Then I enabled root account on the VM and allowed ssh login with root (sudo grep -q '^PermitRootLogin' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && sudo sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config || echo 'PermitRootLogin yes' | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config && sudo systemctl restart sshd) and changed the password of the root to root (sudo passwd root → root  → root) (which isn’t safe of course, so I tried to do the lab asap).  I ran authenticates scan again, which took 12 minutes and found 65 vulnerabilities total (2 high, 1 medium, 1 low and 61 info level). Then I remidiated the vulnerabilities: I disabled the inet, purged telnet and changed the root password for a more complex one. The third scan was the same as the second one. | I think I messed up the commands, and new vulns happen because of making VM with public IP this time. But I got the idea of how it should look. | I will do the lab again, but first I will focus on labs with actual full remidiation. |
| 2025-10-31 (120 minutes) | The Cyber Range | Programmatic Remediation in Windows | Vulnerability Remidiation | Azure, Tenable, github | None (the scan was authorized) | I made Windows 11 VM, logged in and turned of the FW and allowed local accounts to connect remotely with full admin privileges with the PS command I used in earlier labs. On the VM I installed an old version of Wireshark, enabled SMB v1 and enables discouraged cryptographic protocols (SSL 2.0, 3.0 and TLS 1.0, 1.1) with a trusted powershell script I got from github and run it with PS ISE. I restarted the VM and run an authenticated scan. The scan took 41 minutes and found 178 vulnerabilities in total (3 critical, 12 high, 15 medium, 3 low and 145 info level). The most critical ones Wireshark have us (it even had multiple DoS Vulnerabilities), SMB one. After that I got more scripts from the github, this time for remidiation and I ran all of them (for Wireshark, SMBv1 and for discoureged cryptographic protocols) in PS ISE. I restarted the VM and ran an authenticated scan again. This time the duration of the scan was equal to 42 minutes and it found 155 vulnerabilities in total (1 critical, 4 high, 4 medium, 3 low and 143 info level). | I couldn’t connect to the VM after restarting it, and it happened 2-3 times. I figured bastion from azure was probably at fault, so I just made a VM with public IP this time and connected to it with remote desktop control. It worked. | I will do this lab again |
| 2025-10-31 (80 minutes) | The Cyber Range | Programmatic Remediation in Linux | Vulnerability Remidiation | Azure, Tenable, github | None (the scan was authorized) | I made Linux Ubuntu 22 VM, I turend it on and logged into it through SSH, I enabled root account logging through ssh, took the credential, put them into a scan and ran the scan. It took 11 minutes, found 66 vulnerabilities in total (1 critical, 1 medium, 1 low and 63 info level). The critical one is root accounts password set to root (my bad), and the medium one was Open SSL version with multiple vulnerabilities. So I got into the VM and installed and enabled telnet. This time the scan took 28 minutes and found 69 vulnerabilities in total (1 critical, 2 medium, 1 low and 65 info level). New medium one is the unencrypted telnet server. After that I got from github some remediation bash scripts - to change default root password, to remediate OpenSSL version and to remediate Telnet. I ran them all basically with this process: I get the raw code with wget, I make the file executable with chmod +x and then I run the script with ./name-of-the-script command. The files were autodeleting themselves, 1 time I had to ignore certificate for 1 script, and for the other I had to log in again, because it was rebooting at the end of the script. I changed new credentials of the root account in the scan and ran it again. It took 23 minutes and found 63 vulnerabilities in total (1 low and 62 info level). I got rid basically of everything important to the point where I wasn’t sure I accidently didn’t make an unauthorized scan, but checked some info vulns and it turned out we are just fine. | At the beginning I ran unauthorized scan, because I forgot I have to give the scanner more authorization, so I had to do this again. | I will do this lab again |
| 2025-11-08 (120 min) | TryHackMe | SIEM Triage for SOC | Log Analysis with SIEM | Splunk |  | I ran the target machine and connected to it with OpenVPN. I read about benefits of SIEM for Analysts, which is Centralisation, Correlation, ability to see Historical Events and Normalisation. I’ve read about different kinds of Log Sources (Host-Based, Network-Based and Web-Based), what are they consist of (Host-Based: Authentication, System Events, Policy Changes, Object Access, Process Auditing and Account Management); (Network-Based: Firewall Logs, Router Logs, DNS Logs, Proxy Server Logs, VPN Logs, IDS/IPS Logs); (Web-Based: Web Server Logs, API Gateway Logs, Web Apps Logs, Load Balancer Logs, CDN Logs, WAF Logs) and where are thay found/used (Host-Based: web servers, SQL servers, DNS servers, and more); (Network-Based: firewalls, routers, IDS and IPS and other network devices and systems); (Web-Based: Web Application). I’ve read that main windows logs are Sysmon logs (used for eg Malicious Process Execution detection and Suspicious network Connection detection) and WinEventLogs (EVTX) - 2 main ones are Windows Security Logs and Windows System Logs. I’ve used Splunk queries here to conduct an investigation on a suspicious network connection. Had to find information such as: which IP address was the connection established with, which process initaited this suspicious connection, what is the MD5 hash of the malicious process from the previous quiestion and what is the name of the scheduled task that was created on the system. After that I’ve read about Authentication Logs (used to investigate unusual login activities and privilege escalation behaviours) and System Logs (used to investigate eg Persistence Mechanisms). Then I’ve read about Web Log Sources, and why the most useful for analsys are access logs and that you can investigate with them events such as: Brute Force Activity, Possible Web Shell and DDoS Activity. To the Linux logs and Web App Logs I had to make an investigation as well. | I couldn’t figure out queries semantics, because I am used to Sentinel and KQL, but I am getting a hang of it | I’ll train my queries with future rooms |

Later investigation showed that the attack was successful and the user logged in to one of the hosts. After that the attacker escaleted his privileges to root and created an account for persistence. True Positive, escalated. Second scenario: Potential task scheduler persistence identified. Before jumping into splunk I analyzed the host and the user. Name of the host suggested it is a workstation. The user is a System Engineer, which makes sense for him to make scheduled tasks. The task is scheduled to be executed daily, which is not normal. Executed command is clearly malicious “\AppData\Local\Temp\3\DataCollector.exe”. True Positive, escalated. Third scenario: Potential web shell upload detected. After checking on CTI website the suspicious IP is clearly malicious. The user agent is hydra, which indicates BF attack, and logs show the same indication. Excluding the hydra the logs showed POST requests for admin-ajax.php with a referer pointing to theme-editor.php?file=b374k.php - popular webshell. True Positive, escalated. | None | I will use those in my runbooks as well |

A used clicked on a malicious attachment in a phishing email, and ran the file. Threat actor got access to the endpoint and established a connection with C2 server. I analyzed the situation, deleted the email and isolated the endpoint. In the meantime I was writing down notes, and at the end I made a report.

| 2025-12-14 (43 min) | LetsDefend | Disclose The Agent - Challenge | Network Log Analysis | Wireshark, cyberchef | None | I got a pcap file and had to find answers. First I had to find a particular email address. Looked through the packets and found SMTP packets including the email. Then I had to find password to an email. The password was sent in the packets encoded in base64. I used Cyberchef for decoding. Then I had to find name of a file sent in the email. It was easy, I found it at the beginning of TCP stream of sending the file. Then I had to find out information from the file and its MD5 value. So I copied manually the whole encoded file from the stream and saved it to a txt file. Decoded it with bash and saved the decoded value to .docx file. I opened it and there was a pasted location straight from google maps. I answered one of the questions, and then I translated the whole file to MD5 value with bash. And with that I answered all the questions. | First I couldn’t find the stream functionality. And then I wasn’t sure how to translate the whole file so it is readable. I’ve found explanation for MacOS, but I figured it out on Linux. | I’d love to make more of such challenges. |
| 2025-12-14 (35 min) | LetsDefend | Investigate Web Attack - Challenge | Network Log Analysis | None (a raw log file only) | T1595, T1595.003, T1110, T1055, T1136 | So I had an access.log file. First I had to check what tool was used for scanning - UA told me it was Nikto. Then I had to figure out what technique was used for scanning. A pattern in the logs looked like trying a lot of different things from a wordlist - and indeed it was directory brute force. Then I had to discover what was the third attack type - after scanning it looked like a brute force, and indeed it was. Also - I had to figure out if it was successful - it was, the threat actor got the access. The fourth type of attack was code injection - the attacker was using a web shell I believe and was using it through url input. The first payload was a classic “whoami” and after some checking the persistency was established - he created a new account for himself. EDIT: So I figured it out - it was a code injection, but more specifically it was a shell injection with T1202 MITRE technique I believe. The shell was accessed through url, since the user was verified. And also - redirection after brute force means that the brute force was successful. | I didn’t know there was such a technique as directory brute force, but I figured it out.  | Again - I love those challenges. And also - later, when I have more time - I’ll check out walkthrough to see what exactly happened with that code injection. |
| 2025-12-14 (17 min) | LetsDefend | Port Scan Activity - Challenge | Network Log Analysis | Wireshark | T1046 | So there was a pcap file, logs showed a lot of TCP SYN tries from one particular address - the one who was scanning the environment. It started with the most common ports, and then went for higher ports. I had to find MAC address of discovered Apple system. I think it was discovered through open NetBIOS. I inspected the packet and extracted the MAC address. Then I had to find IP address of the detected Windows system. I kinda tried of the the IP address for an answer and it worked. I am not entirely sure what happened here, but I would assume port scanning showed open NetBIOS and then the attacker used the NetBIOS to try to reach other endpoints, and I think it was a success, but again -  I am not entirely sure for now. EDIT: So I actually had to brute force an answer to one of the questions, because the question was unclear, so it makes sense. There are 3 other IP adresses discovered, so I had to guess which one was asked for. As for the last question - apparently only one address had a successful TCP connection with the scanning machine, which indicates that’s the device where Windows System could be, and apparently it is. But all the walkthroughs I’ve found were brute forcing an answer here, so I am still not sure. | I am not entirely sure of the whole attack. | I will check out walkthroughs when I’ll have more time to do that. |
| 2025-12-14 (15 min) | LetsDefend | Remote Working - Challenge | Network Log Analysis | VirusTotal | None | So I had a malware to analyze - the name of it: “ORDER SHEET & SPEC.xlsm”. I had to just go through so TI DB and find some facts about it. I used VirusTotal. I had to find creation date, how Bitdefender AV is detecting it (with what name), how many files are dropped on the disk with this malware running, what’s sha-256 of one of the files dropped, and what’s exact url that I used by the file to download a spyware. | None | None |
| 2025-12-14 (5 min) | LetsDefend | Shellshock Attack | Network Log Analysis | Wireshark | Some kind of injection I think | So I had a pcap file and it looked like a threat actor had an access to one of the enpoints and was trying to figure it out what are other enpoints and I think he figured out which IP address was a web server, so he tried to add/inject himself as a user/admin? I am not sure though, I’ll figure it out later. Anyway - One of the server operating systems sent 500 error and it gave away that it the OS was Ubuntu and the web app server was running on Apache/2.2.22. Then I had to paste the exact command with which he tried to inject himself. EDIT: Yeah, so guys from walkthroughs aren’t sure either, but here the threat actor probably injected some code and made the server unresponsive, and the 500 response gave away right information. I have to go through web attacks module to understand all of this I presume. | I am not sure what exactly happened. | I will check walkthroughs later to figure it out. |

Even the name matches: GoogleUpdate.exe. On endpoint the file was ran, and the location of the file matches the proper Google Update location. Browser history supports the story that the user was looking how to update his Google Chrome. In logs there were no suspicious connections, especially none around the time of running the file. The file was not quarantined as well. Running the file on the sandbox does not create any suspicious processes or connections as well. All the evidence shows that the file is NOT malicious. I also added md5 hash of the file to the artifacts, so that our Security Engineering team has easier job with tuning in those detection rules. False positive. | In my first try I though it is a true positive. There was some suspicious process created around the time of running the file on VM, but it was probably an cloud agent and connection, but it wasn’t flagged by AVs in CTI DB - community was flagging it, but then I discoverd it was internal IP for DNS in cloud. So people maybe thought it was malicious, but it was not. I had to read thourougly a walkthrough and then I made again my analysis. | I will do more such incidents. |

Logs were checked - the connection was indeed establish to download the file, but there was no malicious file downloaded. The url is clean - 2 diffrent TI databases confirmed it - it is an official win-rar link. No malicious connections or processes detected on the endpoint. The alert is considered false positive - the file was indeed downloaded, but the file wasn't malicious. | Nothing really - all was clear | I will do more incidents like this as well |
| 2025-12-21 (17 min) | LetsDefend | SOC104 - Malware Detected (EventID: 36) | Alert Investigation | VirusTotal | T1486, T1105 | On December 1, 2020, 10:23 AM an alert was fired - Malware Detected. Checking File hash confirmed indeed that it is a confirmed ransomware malware. Upon checking internet connections in logs they showed that a connection was performed 7 minutes after the alert was triggered - to a confirmed malicious IP address, most probably a C2 server, where the files were gathered. Malware analysis confirmed that the malware is indeed dangerous. The endpoint was isolated. I advise to blacklist the malicious IP and run an AV scan. | None | I will do more of these incidents |

And no malicious activity on the endpoint as well (no malicious processes or commands were written, especially around the timestamp). The file was cleaned right away and logs confirm - it wasn't ran. Checking the hash file in CTI database confirms that it is a malware indeed - trojan emotet. True positive - the file was properly detected but neutralized before anything bad happened. | None | I will do more incidents for sure |
| 2025-12-21 (24 min) | LetsDefend | Malicious Doc - Challenge | Malware Analysis Fundamentals | HybridAnalysis, VirusTotal | T1064 | It was quite simple - I had to use Hybrid Analysis tool and Virus Total to figure out answers - what type of exploit is running, what CVE is applicable, what malicious software is downloaded upon running the malware, what IP is communicated and what exe file does it drop. All the answers I’ve found on VirusTotal, but to be sure I also used HybridAnalysis to confirm my answers. | None | None |

That wasn’t easy but I figured it out. Variables were weirdly named, so the analysis was harder, and it was constructed in the way that reading actual intentions wasn’t easy. On top of that actual commands and inputs were encoded in hex, buit CyberChef was helpful here. The actual code wasn’t that fancy - its goal was to establish connection with a potential C2 server and get some info about the endpoint, if I am not mistaken. I had to find out through what url payload was downloaded, what was the filename of the payload, what method was used to establish an HTTP connection, what user-agent string was using, what object was used by the attacker to be able to read or write text and binary files, and what object was used by the attacker for WMI execution. Fun activity. | None | I’d like to do more such cases. I like analyzing malware statically. |

First of all it looked like a web server that was at first scanned from a wordlist and from different IP addresses. Then, some of the IPs tried to do some code injection, possibly with log4j exploit (if I understood correctly). I also had to streatch my Wireshark skills with filtering. I had to find specific IP address destination that received the payload (starting with “=$jndi:ldap://”), then I had to find in a packet in what year was it sent, then I had to count how many packets had dst port 80 and TCP protocol, then I had to count how many packets was exchanged between 2 ip addresses (I did it with one query), and lastly I had to find how many IP addresses tried using one specific payload (the payload with one specific address in it). | I didn’t know at first how to do the queries cleverly, but I figured it out. And I wanted to find some packets manually, so it took a bit of time, but I am glad I did that. | I’d like to make more challenges like this. |

I checked the logs and indeed, 2 minutes earlier the user downloaded the installer from the win-rar[.]com legitemate website (I checked the website in CTI database). There were no wired processes or network traffic. I even tried the .exe file in the sandbox - and it indeed was legitimate win-rar installer. False Positive. | Nothing | I’ll make more investigations soon |

There is a process showing that the ab.exe file was ran. Also then there are processes showing that the shadow copy of files was at least checked (wbadmin.exe, vssadmin.exe, bcdedit.exe). There are no network files available. Hash of the file when checked on CTI database told me that it is indeed a ransomware and a trojan. I cannot be for sure that someone accessed a C2 server, because there are no logs indicating it - but they might be just stolen/encrypted/inaccessible. I couldn't properly check the ransomware because it was .bin file, and I couldn't mount it virtually (not sure why). But strong evidence from the VT database and lack of other logs except some processes and processes indicating that shadow copy was accessed is enough in this case. True positive. | I couldn’t access the .bin file. The victim probably mounted the ransomware physically but I couldn’t do it virtually. I didn’t try it more since I wanted to take it realistically and I concluded that evidence I found was enough. | I’ll figure out why I couldn’t virtually mount the .bin file. |

I had to look for help online and I found an article, but the article wasn’t specific enough, so I had to find github and see what people were talking about the problem specifically. Basically I had to update some variable in one of the files for it to work properly. I took A WHILE. Yeah, and then it was easy - I just had to figure out how the macro works, which I did more or less. It was enough to answer questions. But hey - that’s how it is going to be sometimes, right? | I had fix a tool by myself, which I did, but it took a while. | I’ll do more challanges |

I was mostly going along the walkthrough because I wasn’t sure how to use the tools - the documentation was in the github files. I discovered that doc and docx files are a bit like a zip file, and I had to look into them with zipdump and had to look for specific answers with re-search. I used numers-to-string since I had to decode some part of a code. | I was going mainly along the walkthrough | I’ll try to use the specifics of files and tools I used in the future |

The SMTP address isn't in CTI database, nor the senders email address. The email do not have proper email structure you would expect from corporate. The subject of the email starts with RE:, which wasn't an answer. Also the attachment have a wired name, like randomly generated characters, which is another indicator. The contents of the file are indeed malicious. (I couldn't open the file in the sandbox this time, but I was analyzing it in one of the challenges). Logs indicate that the files were ran and the endpoint was connected to 2 malicious IP addresses, C2 servers associated with this malware. All the IoCs were included. The email was deleted and the endpoint was isolated. True Positive. | I coudn’t open the malware in the sandbox this time, the file was giving unknown error.

Logs indicate that the person indeed clicked on a phishing link. The link has the users email as a parameter added to the phishing website. Checking out the URL address in CTI DB tells us that it is indeed malicious. And even though the destination address isn't considered malicious by AV scans, CTI DB shows that it is associated with many malicious files found in the DB (VT DB). The host got isolated.

Suspicious email was sent from a safe SMTP address, but the contents gave it away - no personalization, focused email on urgency, strange attachment, strangely named, password protected. Checking the file in a sandbox have me all the info - it was a PDF file saved as html file, where the file looked blured. Clicking on anything was automatically redirecting to this URL: [https://a.pomf.cat/hgfetb.R11](https://a.pomf.cat/hgfetb.R11). Checking the URL and the files MD5 hash in CTI DB confirmed - both IoCs are malicious. Forutnately the systems blocked the email, so no further damage was caused. It is advised to block all the IPs and URLs contained in the IoCs list. True Positive. | None | I’ll do more of those cases |

The email contained no personalization, was not written in a standard structure of a corporate email or a proper email in this regard, an attachment had suspicious name and was password protected. Upon checking the attachment with anyrun and HybridAnalysis (I tired to check the file with a sandbox, but unknown error occured) turned out the file is malicious. Fortunately there were no signs of the file running nor connecting to the C2 server. The IoCs are attached to the list. It is advised to block SMTP server address and senders email. True Positive. | I got one thing wrong - the file was actually ran on the endpoint. I don’t know if it’s a bug, because I checked associated C2 servers connections. | I’ll do the alert again another time. |

Checking the suspicious address in CTI DBes (VT, abuseipdb) confirmed that the IP address is malicious, associated with many cases of SSH BF attacks. The potential attack was performed on the companies' webserver. The requested URL looked indeed suspicious. After decoding the attack was confirmed - the URL contained known SQLi pattern [" OR 1 = 1 -- -]. It wasn't a planned pentest, since there was no sign of it in companies' emails. There wasn't used any Attack Simulation products as well (no sign of it in user-agent), so it also checks out for a real attack. The direction of attack was from the Internet to the Company Network. The network logs show that the attacker tried different SQLi patterns, and one of the entries stand out with its size - we can assume the attack was successful. I already isolated the device. I am escalating the case to Tier 2. True Positive. | The attack actually wasn’t successful - every SQLi attempt had the same answer size. I mistaken normal access to the website as the successful SQLi attack. | I’ll do the alert once again later. |

The suspicious source IP is associated with SSH BF attacks (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB). Checking the logs - there was a traffic that went through FW and reached the destination address; the POST Parameters were clearly command injections, including "whoami". The different response size tell us that the commands successfully reached the target. It is not a planned test, there are no signs of any pentests. EDR logs show that the commands reached the target and were executed on the host. I isolated the device. I advise to add the malicious source IP address to a blacklist (the IP is found in the added IoC list). I escalated the case to Tier 2 with IoC list attached. True Positive. | I wasn’t sure about response sizes, but now they were different, and I did the whole case correctly, so I believe I start to get it. | I’ll do more such cases. |

The traffic goes from our endpoint to a cloudflare CDN. It's just normal queries. The query/URL that fired the rule contained "ls" in itself "https://letsdefend.io/blog/?s=skills". There are no signs of compromise in network logs and EDR logs. There is nothing to attack. I advise our security engineering team to tune the rule. False Positive. | I answered one question wrong - they asked if there are other instances of traffic, I though that they mean malicious traffic, so I said no. But yeah, there were other queries sent. My bad, I won’t be doing the case again. | I’ll do more cases as this one. |

The Source IP looked at least suspicious on CTI DBes (VT, AbuseIPDB) since it was associated with SSH BF attacks. Checking network logs confirmed that there were different tries, different response sizes, 200 status responses and IDOR pattern confirmed. EDR logs doesn't show any signs of compromise, but the logs showed that the attacker tried to get information about different users, and he didn't try to change anything. Anyway - the host was contained, and the case escalated. True Positive. | So my actions were all correct, but I misunderstood the URL queries: the attacker actually TRIED to change some information of some users. My bad. Either way - the actions were correct. | I’ll do more cases as this one. |

The source IP is considered malicious, since it is associated with SSH BF attacks (VT, AbuseIPDB). Analyzing network logs show that the URL request was a typical LFI attempt, but the response was 0 in size and 500 in code. EDR logs show no signs of compromise. It looks like the URL request broke our web server, but it didn't look like DoS attack, so as an LFI attack I consider this attack to be a failure. I advise to add the malicious IP address to a blacklist. True Positive. | I wasn’t sure if the attack was successful or not, since the server got downed and there could be some info in the response, but the reponse size was 0, so it was fine. But still - they achieved something, but it didn’t look like they tried perform DoS attack. So I’ve decided the attack wasn’t successful and I was right. | I’ll do more cases as this one. |

Examining the file on CTI DB confirmed that the file is indeed malicious (trojan). Checking the EDR logs confirmed, that some kind of encoded payload was ran, which fits the file. (I couldn't run the file in my sandbox, becasue it is set by the LetsDefend and there is no excel automatically. In the future I will make my own VM properly prepared).

| 2026-01-01 (42 min) | LetsDefend | Brute Force Attacks - Challenge | Detecting Brute Force Attacks | Wireshark | T1110 | The challenge was difficult. I had to really dive in into the tools and learn new tricks to get the answer in an easier way. I had a PCAP file and auth.log file. First I had to find the targeted servers IP. I did it with a PCAP file by looking for a destination IP. Then I had to check targeted directory. I found it in HTTP request connections. Than I had to find correct username and password combination used for login. I used PCAP file as well. I filtered http traffic and NOT equal to the most common answer size. It helped me to easily find an answer with different size. The log before that had the answer. Then I had to find how many user accounts attacker tried to compromise via RDP brute force, I used src.ip as a filter for the attacker and RDP traffic and Cookie in the decsription of the packet and counted different users (But I don’t know why the answer was different than my findings since I brute forced it). Then I had to find the clinet name of the attacker’s machine, which I did with looking at ClientData packets. Then I had to check what was the last successful logon, and I used auth.log for that and greped the Accepted, and looked at the last entry. Then I had to find how many unsuccessful login attempts were made. I greped auth log, searched for Failed login(? or sth simmilar, the VM closed) and counted lines with wc -l, and there was the answer. And MITRE technique was the easiest - I know T1110 by heart. | I brute forced one of the answers and I am not sure why there had to be less users than there actually was, since all the users in there were brute forced (in terms of attempts at least). EDIT: I read a walthrough and now I know - I had to set dst ip of the server and not src ip of the client. My bad. | I liked the challenge. It was tough. I’d like to make more such rooms. |

The source IP address is evidently malicious (VT, abuseIPDB). Checking the network logs confirm that the IP address tried many times to attack our server with SQL Injection and scan our ports. The reponse codes and response sizes shows that none of the SQL injections were successful. One problem is that I cannot find the attacked endpoint in our db whatsoever. It's either successful DoS attack or it is just a bug. Either way, the SQL injection attack was unsuccessful. Normally I would of course check EDR logs, but I am not able to in this situation. There are no emails mentioning of a planned pentesting within the timeframe of the attack. The attacked IoC list contains the malicious IP address. My verdict: True Positive. | So I do not have reponse logs so I cannot tell if the reponse was received, but the 200 response code indicates that the queries reached the db. So I cannot be sure that the attack was unseccessful, so the correct actions would be to escalate. My bad. | I will keep in mind the new knowledge about SQLi and 200 response code. |

Checking the file hash confirms that the file is malicious. EDR logs confirm that the user searched the link to download the file in the browser. Network logs confirm that the connection for accessing the file was established, and right after that a connection with a malicious IP address through port 80 was established as well. I checked the IP address and it is indeed associated with malware. Taking all of the clues into consideration I assumed the endpoint is compromised. I isolated it.

The source IP is considered malicious according to our CTI db + VT and AbuseIPDB. Checking the network logs shows that the attacker was trying to brute force different accounts, but with no success. Then he tried our victims account, and he got it after a few tries and logged in. EDR logs showed that the attacker started to check where he is, what users and groups there are, and went straight to persistence phase with making himself a new account. I isolated the endpoint. I advise our team to add attached IoC to our blacklist. True Positive.

Lessons Learned

How did the cyber attack happen?
The password was brute-forced.

How well did staff and management perform in dealing with the incident?
There was no action beside me, but I isolated the device within 10 minutes.

What would the staff and management do differently the next time a similar incident occurs?
I would change the alert severity to high, or make a rule that detects when the brute force attack is successful, so there is an alert with a critical severity.

What corrective actions can prevent similar incidents in the future?
Better password policy (longer and more complex passwords), MFA

What precursors or indicators should be watched for in the future to detect similar incidents?
First at least a couple of failed logins withing the short period of time, and then a successful login from the same IP or on the same account. | None | I’d love to do more of such cases |

| 2026-01-03 (25 min) | LetsDefend | SOC326 - Impersonating Domain MX Record Change Detected (EventID: 304) | Alert Investigation | VirusTotal | T1566.002 | On Sep, 17, 2024, 12:05 PM alert fired: "SOC326 - Impersonating Domain MX Record Change Detected (EventID: 304)". It is our service that automatically alert us when our domain is impersonated. Upon thourough investigation the record change is confirmed, and there is found an impersonating domain (letsdefwnd[.]io), and it is very new so it is clear sign that there could be phishing attempts happening. But nonetheless the email itself wasn't phishing, so I cannot qualify it as one. Fale Positive.
EDIT: So the playbook is not crafted properly for this type of situation. I was going straight with it and failed. So since the mailing domain was used, upon searching in our email db we can find that an email from the phishing domain was sent to one of our employees. The phishing domain was accessed from the victims host. Network logs confirm that the malicious domain as connected, and its IP is associated with malware. I deleted the email and isolated the endpoint. I advise to add attacked IoCs to a blacklist. True Positive. | None | None |
| 2026-01-03 (21 min) | LetsDefend | SOC275 - Application Token Steal Attempt Detected (EventID: 250) | Alert Investigation | VirusTotal, urlscan.io, AbuseIPDB | T1566.002 | On Apr, 19, 2024, 08:23 AM alert fired: "SOC275 - Application Token Steal Attempt Detected (EventID: 250)". Upon checking out the emails they seem fine - they are sent from official discordglobal(.)com domain. It looks like the client tried changing their password on discord. Even if they didn't try that - there was nothing wrong with the email. False Positive.
EDIT: So apparently the link that is located as a CTA button in the email leads to a domain associated with phishing in the past. I saw no such ecidence when looking by a domain, but taking the IP address it confirms that. I deleted the email and isolated the device. I advise our team to add the attacked IoCs to a blacklist. True Positive. | None | None |
| 2026-01-03 (26 min) | LetsDefend | SOC251 - Quishing Detected (QR Code Phishing) (EventID: 214) | Alert Investigation | VirusTotal | T1566.002 | On Jan, 01, 2024, 12:37 PM alarm fired: "SOC251 - Quishing Detected (QR Code Phishing) (EventID: 214)". Checking the SMTP Address on CTI DB confirmed that the address is malicious, associated with phishing. Upon checking network logs it was confirmed that the email was indeed deliverd to the host. The contents of the email are suspicious in terms of pushed urgency to scan a QR Code and reminding that a failure to do that in a set period of time will have negative consequences. Infortunately the QR Code isn't loading for me. I asked discord LetsDefend staff but they are not responding, so I have to go without it. There are no signs of account compromise nor the host compromise - EDR logs are perfectly normal. True Positive. | None | None |
| 2026-01-03 (20 min) | LetsDefend | SOC246 - Forced Authentication Detected (EventID: 208) | Alert Investigation | VirusTotal | T1595, T1595.002, T1110.004 | On Dec, 12, 2023, 02:15 PM alart fired: "SOC246 - Forced Authentication Detected (EventID: 208)". Source IP upon checking in the CTI DB (VT) was confirmed malicious. Netowrk logs confirm that the attacker first tried scanning different ports of our server. Then he started doing some password guessing and spraying, probably using RockYou.txt list. He went through different generic accounts trying different generic passwords, but he figured it out and logged into an admin account. He went through our test subdomain, which wasn't secure enough and he exploited it. The server isn't available in our logs, so I couldn't check it. It's either a bug or the attacker made it unavailable/wiped it. I advise L2 to look into it. I advise our security team to add attached IoCs to a blacklist. I escalate the incident. True Positive. | I used terms like password spraying and guessing. It was actually Credential Stuffing. | None |
| 2026-01-03 (17 min) | LetsDefend | SOC211 - Utilman.exe Winlogon Exploit Attempt (EventID: 161) | Alert Investigation | VirusTotal | T1564, T1036, T1136, T1098.007 | On Jun, 21, 2023, 11:02 AM alert fired: "SOC211 - Utilman.exe Winlogon Exploit Attempt (EventID: 161)". Upon checking the EDR logs - processes show very strange activity - cmd.exe is changed with utilman.exe, and then commands go through utilman.exe, and the parent of the processes is winlogon.exe, while the process hash is still cmd.exe. Upon a quick google search it is confirmed that it is a known way to get into locked Win 10 computer. After that the utilman.exe processes make themselves a new account and add the new account to administrator group. It is clearly a persistence move. I isolated the endpoint. True Positive. | None | That was cool, I’d like to do more such cases |
| 2026-01-05 (39 min) | LetsDefend | SOC163 - Suspicious Certutil.exe Usage (EventID: 113) | Alert Investigation | VirusTotal | T1105, T1595.001, T1595.002, T1555, T1059 | On Mar, 01, 2022, 11:06 AM alert fired: "Suspicious Certutil.exe Usage (EventID: 113)". Upon investigating the host it was confirmed that 2 suspicious tools were downloaded with certutil.exe. Before that, it looks like the host was used normally, but this process occured: "vmware-usbarbitrator64.exe". Terminal history shows that before that typical exploration commands were used: "whoami", "net user", "ipconfig". After that the tools were downloaded. First one used was nmap, it was used to scan internal network (nmap -sV 192.168.0.0/24 -p 80). After that the other tool was used and ran - to check if the windows has any vulnerabilities. A couple hours later, in the evening a suspicious command was ran as well: "findstr /si pass *.txt | *.xml| *.ini". But the Last Login (Apr, 11, 2022, 03:22 PM) and browser history suggest normal use after that. Moreover - browser history suggests that the user was trying to learn python and similar tools. But the actions were too suspicious to me. I isolated the host. And I highly recommend to investigate this instance further. I call it True Positive, because the tools were used. | None | That was such an interesting case. I’d love to do more cases like this one. |
