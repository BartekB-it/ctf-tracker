| 2025-08-05 (10-15 min) | TryHackMe | Offensive Security Intro | Basic concepts | fake Brute-Force tool to check if there are any hidden urls | T1110 | Red teaming can be called offesive hacking and blue teaming - defensive hacking | Nothing really | Checking real world names for such tools |
| 2025-08-05 (ok. 30 min) | TryHackMe | Defensive Security Intro | SOC / Blue Team | fake SIEM, fake OSINT for IP and blocking IP with fake firewall for good | T1110 | Blue team is much more than just looking at logs - it’s actively looking what can be done to improve the defense, what is going on in real time, if there is something - classifying it as a threat or not and if there is a threat - escalating it to sb higher in your team. Also making sure there are relevant policies for people to go by. It all sounds super interesting. And I learned that the projects I do are now making so much more sense. Also - it gave me good ideas for more detection rules in my LogSniper | Nothing really, it was fun and informative | I could write down the theory stuff and try to memorize it more, becasue it sounded useful. Checking real world names for such tools |
